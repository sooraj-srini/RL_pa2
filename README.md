# Introduction

This is our submission for CS6700 Reinforcement Learning Programming Assignment 2. 
In this project, we look at the performance of two algorithms: Dueling DQN and the Monte-Carlo REINFORCE algorithm. 
We compare the performance of these two algorithms on the Acrobot-v1 and the CartPole-v1 environments.
