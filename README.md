# Introduction

This is our submission for CS6700 Reinforcement Learning Programming Assignment 2. 
In this project, we look at the performance of two algorithms: Dueling DQN and the Monte-Carlo REINFORCE algorithm. 
We compare the performance of these two algorithms on the Acrobot-v1 and the CartPole-v1 environments. 

# Reproducing the results

To reproduce the results, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- gymnasium
- numpy
- torch
- matplotlib
- tqdm

# Todo:

- [x] Add code for Double DQN
- [x] Add code for REINFORCE
- [x] Understand what a target network is and use it
- [x] Use a Replay Buffer too if necessary
- [ ] Train it on the environment
